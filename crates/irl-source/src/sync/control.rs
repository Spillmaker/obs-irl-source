//! The per-source timecode sync controller as it sits on the receiver thread:
//! the delay line of encoded packets, the pure loop in `irl_core::sync`, and
//! the glue between them and the pipeline (the NTP reference, the audio
//! playout mapping, the priming gate, the log). Port of the C branch's
//! `sync-control.c` (Spillmaker/obs-irl-source `nal-timecodes`).
//!
//! Known limitation, inherited: the delay line drains on the receiver thread,
//! which is also the thread that blocks in `av_read_frame`. A total delivery
//! gap therefore stalls releases even though the line holds data that is due.
//! That is no worse than the plugin behaves without a delay line — the gap
//! costs the same concealment either way — but the buffering here does not
//! add stall resilience.
