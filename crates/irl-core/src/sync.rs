//! Timecode sync: absolute-time presentation control (port of the C branch's
//! `sync-control.c`, minus the pipeline it steers).
//!
//! Every synced source targets the same rule: the frame stamped T is presented
//! at NTP time T + offset. Sources do not negotiate; the alignment falls out of
//! both ends sharing a clock. Two OBS instances anywhere, on the same NTP
//! reference and the same offset, composite the same captured moment at the
//! same instant — which is why the offset is one global number rather than a
//! per-source setting.
//!
//! There is exactly one actuator — a delay line of *encoded* packets in front
//! of the decoders ([`DelayLine`]) — and one loop driving it
//! ([`SyncController`]). Holding compressed packets is a requirement, not an
//! optimisation: a second of a 6Mbit/s feed is under a megabyte compressed and
//! ~190MB decoded at 1080p60.
//!
//! Nothing in the audio pipeline changes. Delaying the input shifts the whole
//! PTS-to-OBS mapping with it, so the jitter buffer, the speed controller and
//! the video pacing all keep doing exactly what they did — they simply see the
//! stream arrive later. Every rate below is set under the speed controller's
//! -2%/+5% authority for that reason.
//!
//! This module is the arithmetic and the state machine, with every input —
//! the clocks, the NTP reference, the audio playout mapping, the settings —
//! passed in per packet, so the whole loop is testable on a virtual clock. The
//! plugin crate owns the packets, the locks and the log lines.
